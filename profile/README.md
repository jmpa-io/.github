# `jmpa`

👉 `🇯ust 🇲e 🇵laying 🇦round` 👈

A GitHub organization for [me](https://github.com/jcleal) to play around with various projects.

> Also, in Australia, a hoodie is sometimes referred to as a jumper – hence the logo.

### **`Overview`**

Below is an overview of my thinking for ANY repository in this GitHub org:

```markdown
⚫ Use GitHub Actions (primarily for CI/CD).

🟠 Try and open-source as much as possible, but in a way that is secure.

🔴 Any projects that needs to be deployed is actually deployed somewhere (primarily AWS or my Homelab 🏡)

🟡 If able, use a Makefile as the root entrypoint for any project or repository.

🟢 To use `GitHub Templates` as a way of enforcing consistantcy across MOST GitHub repositories in this org.

🔵 To create custom `GitHub Actions` to handle common problems across various workflows.

🟣 Write most things from scratch, unless an offical "thing" is provided (that can be trusted).

🟤 Have fun! 🎉

```
