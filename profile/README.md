ðŸ‘‰ `J`ust `M`e `P`laying `A`round ðŸ‘ˆ

A GitHub organization for [me](https://github.com/jcleal) to play around with projects.

### **`Goals`**

```markdown
âš« To use GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

ðŸŸ  To have public + private projects using private secrets here, with some secrets being automatically rotated.

ðŸ”´ Any projects that need to be deployed are actually deployed to a personal AWS account.

ðŸŸ¢ To use GitHub Templates as away of enforcing consistantcy across most repositories.

ðŸ”µ To create custom `GitHub Actions` to handle "standard" workflows.

> (i.e. posting to Slack, linting, templating, etc.)

ðŸŸ£ Writing most things from scratch, unless an offical "thing" is provided that can be trusted.

> (i.e. like a `GitHub Action` for authing to an AWS account, posting to Slack, etc.)
```
