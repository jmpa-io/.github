### **`Ideals & Guidelines`**

Below outlines the ideals & guidelines for most repositories in this org:

```markdown
âš« Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

ðŸŸ  Try and open-source as much as possible, but in a way that is secure.

ðŸ”´ Any projects that needs to be deployed is actually deployed to an AWS account.

ðŸŸ¢ To use `GitHub Templates` as a way of enforcing consistantcy across MOST GitHub repositories in this org.

ðŸ”µ To create custom `GitHub Actions` to handle common problems across various workflows.

ðŸŸ£ Write most things from scratch, unless an offical "thing" is provided (that can be trusted).
```
