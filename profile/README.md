**What this this org?**

This is a personal GitHub organization for me to play around with projects.

> [Click here to see a list of the public projects.](https://github.com/jmpa-io?q=&type=public&language=&sort=)

The goal of this is:

âš« To use GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

ðŸŸ  To have public + private projects using private secrets here, with some being automatically rotated.

ðŸ”´ Any projects that need to be deployed are deployed to a personal AWS account.

ðŸŸ¢ To use GitHub Templates as away of enforcing consistantcy across most repositories.

ðŸ”µ To create custom `GitHub Actions` to handle "standard" workflows.

> (i.e. posting to Slack, linting, templating, etc.)

ðŸŸ£ Writing most things myself, unless an offical "thing" is provided that I can trust (or if I just want to write it from scratch).

> (i.e. like a `GitHub Action` for authing to an AWS account, posting to Slack, etc.)
