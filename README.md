</div>

See [this doc](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-the-dot-github-repository/) for a breakdown on what exactly a `.github` repository does. Here's also the official [GitHub doc](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file) for this too.

# TODOs

* Create "something" that updates the profile/README.md with the languages for each repo here: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#list-repository-languages
